# ChattyApp Project

=====================

ChattyApp allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. Users may enter their name which is then displayed next to their message posts, or go by "Anonymous". Each user is assigned a random colour when connected. The user's name in each message post is then displayed in their associated colour.

ChattyApp is built using React as well as modern Node tools including Webpack and Babel.
